</p><p>Welcome to Advanced Operating Systems! We're going to start
by compiling Linux from source. Even if you've done this kind of thing
before, this studio will get you the source code and resources that 
this class depends on, along with additional experience working with 
the Raspberry Pi platform.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up your <i>Raspberry Pi 3</i>
  </li><li>Download the Linux source code and apply a source code patch
  </li><li>Configure the Linux kernel 
  </li><li>Compile and install your own custom kernel
</li></ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
</p><p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
finished email your results to <strong>eng-cse522@email.wustl.edu</strong> with
the phrase <strong>
Welcome To Linux Studio
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>To start, you need to set up your <i>Raspberry Pi 3</i> so that you're
able to access a working version of Linux. If you have the reccommended starter
kit from Canakit, you can follow 
<a href="http://www.canakit.com/Media/CanaKit-Raspberry-Pi-Quick-Start-Guide-1.0.pdf">
these directions</a>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This course was developed using
the default Raspbian distribution. You're free to use other distributions, but
you're on your own if something doesn't work properly. You will need a
graphical interface later in the course.<p></p>

<p>Once you have successfully booted into Linux, you can use the command
<code>uname</code> to get a variety of information about the currently
running system, such as the current kernel version or the date on which
the currently running kernel was compiled. As the answer to this exercise,
copy and paste the output of the command "<code>uname -a</code>". 

</p><p></p></li><li>Now it's time to download the Linux kernel source code and patch it.
For a general-purpose project, you would go to <a href="http://kernel.org/">kernel.org</a> and
download the Linux source from there. However, since we're using the
<i>Raspberry Pi</i> we'll be starting with a port designed for our platform. 
The Raspberry Pi project maintains it's own distribution on GitHub, at
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi">https://github.com/raspberrypi</a>.
We'll be modifying the kernel building guide that you can find
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/linux/kernel/building.md">
here</a>.
<p></p>

<p>To save hours of time, and avoid potential <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/classFAQ.html#PiFreezing">freezing of your Raspberry Pi</a> during 
long-running <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/onboard_compilation.html">local compiles</a>, we will 
be cross-compiling the kernel using a university-managed server 
(<code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code>) and machines in the Linux Lab.</p>

<p>First log into <code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code> via ssh using your wustl key.</p>
<p>Create a folder called <code>linux_source</code> to keep all of your source code organized.
Move into your new folder and issue the following commands, each of 
which may take several minutes to finish:</p>

<p><code>wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/archive/raspberrypi-kernel_1.20160506-1.tar.gz</code></p>

<p><code>tar -xzf raspberrypi-kernel_1.20160506-1.tar.gz</code></p>

<p>This has the effect of downloading a specific version of the
<i>Raspberry Pi 3</i> Linux distribution, which is the version that
this course was developed with. Newer versions exist, which we won't
use for class but you can pursue on your own time if you'd like. Once
the files finish unpacking you'll have a new directory, which we
suggest renaming as something simpler with the <code>mv</code>
command. We renamed ours <strong>linux</strong>, which is what the
rest of these instructions will assume you've done as well.</p>

<p> Move into your new <strong>linux</strong> directory, and issue the 
command <code>make kernelversion</code>, which will tell you which Linux 
kernel version you've just checked out.  As the answer to this exercise, copy the output of
the command <code>make kernelversion</code></p>

<p></p></li><li>Next, you will apply a Linux source code patch. Source code
patches are the way that cutting-edge kernel software is shared among kernel
hackers. Long before features find their way into major distributions they
exist as source code patches, and many contributions that aren't accepted into the
Linux mainline exist only as source code patches. In this case, we're going to
apply the PREEMPT_RT patch, which allows the kernel to be fully preemptible.<p></p>

<p>First, go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/">kernel.org/pub/linux</a>, 
which is the public Linux source code repository, and click through "kernel",
"projects", and then "rt". You will need to use the answer to the previous
exercise in order to find the correct source code patch that matches the
version of the Linux kernel that you're using. For example, if you have source
code version "4.0.7", then you will move to the directory "4.0" and get
"patch-4.0.7-rt11.patch.gz". (<strong>Warning: do NOT use the file that starts
with "patches"</strong>, the patch file contains the complete, current version
of the patch, while the patches file contains data necessary to update from the
last issued version of the rt patch.)</p>

<p>Move into your <code>linux_source</code> directory and use <code>wget</code> to obtain the 
appropriate patch file ending in gz. To apply the patch, move into your
<strong>linux</strong> source code directory (the one with arch, drivers, init, etc.) 
and issue the following command: (you will need to change version numbers)</p>
<p><code>zcat ../patch-4.0.7-rt11.patch.gz | patch -p1</code></p>

<p>The <code>zcat</code> command works like the <code>cat</code> command, but 
does so for compressed files. If you just issue the command
<code>zcat ../patch-4.0.7-rt11.patch.gz</code> by itself you'll see
that the source code patch is actually stored in <code>diff</code> format.
The vertical bar character pipes the output of <code>zcat</code> into 
another program called <code>patch</code>, which just applies each individual
diff to the appropriate files in the source code directory.</p> 

<p>If no errors are reported, then proceed to the next step. Leave this
answer blank.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Now it's time to configure the Linux kernel. There are thousands of
possible configuration options- many quite interesting and many quite dull.
Rather than setting all these options manually, we'll
we'll create the default <i>Raspberry Pi 3</i> configuration and then
tweak it. Issue the commands:<p></p>

<p><code>module add raspberry</code> (this adds the cross-compiler to your PATH variable)</p>
<p><code>KERNEL=kernel7</code> (this is used by some build scripts)</p>

<p><strong>Note that in some terminal environments (depending on how you have set up
your account on <code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code>) you may need to do this using the set command:
<code>set KERNEL=kernel7</code></strong></p>

<p><code>make -j8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- bcm2709_defconfig</code></p>

<p>To reiterate, if you were building a general purpose kernel, you wouldn't use the
previous two commands. They're setting a default configuration for Raspberry Pi . 
Next, we want to set custom configuration options. Issue the command:</p>

<p><code>make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig</code></p>

<p>After a moment, you'll get a kernel configuration menu. As you can see,
there are a _lot_ of options. 
For now, we're just going to do two things.
First, we will enable the RT_PREEMPT patch we applied
previously. Go into "Kernel Features", and then
select "Preemption Model". If the patch was applied correctly, you'll
have the option "Fully Preemptible Kernel (RT)", which you should select.</p>

<p>Next you'll add your own unique identifier to the kernel you build.
Navigate to "Local version" under "General setup". The local version
string you specify here will be appended to the output of the 
<code>uname</code> command. If you applied the default <i>Raspberry Pi</i>
configuration correctly, this should be set to "<code>-v7</code>". Go ahead
and add your own unique identifier, though recall that <code>uname</code>
already gives you the kernel version number, the day and time the kernel was
compiled, as well as other info.<b>Warning: do not include a space in the
local version string- this will break the build script when you run 
<code>sudo make modules_install</code> in the future</b>.</p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, find a neat sounding option and use the
"H" key to bring up a short description. Provide the option's name, a short
summary, and the option's symbol. Once you're done, exit the configurator
and be sure to answer "Yes" when asked to save your changes.</p> 


<p></p></li><li>Finally, we're able to start compiling the kernel. This would take 
about an hour and a half if we were <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/onboard_compilation.html">building 
the kernel locally on your Raspberry Pi</a>
instead of cross-compiling.<p> Because kernel compiles are 
computationally intensive, you should not run them on the <code>shell.cec.wustl.edu</code> server,
and instead should run the <code>qlogin</code> command to log into a Linux Lab host 
to run your compilations.</p><p>

Once you are logged into one of the Linux Lab machines, confirm that you are still in
your <code>linux_source/linux</code> directory (or if not <code>cd</code> into it).
Then, issue the following commands to cross-compile the kernel:</p>

<p><code>module add raspberry</code></p>
<p><code>KERNEL=kernel7</code></p>
<p><code>make -j8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage modules dtbs</code></p>

<p>The compile will take several minutes. Once it's done, issue the following command:</p>
<p><code>mkdir ../modules</code></p><p> 

This will create a directory that the cross-compiler will use to store
the kernel modules that it creates. You will later transfer these to
your Raspberry Pi. Then issue the command:

</p><p><code>make -j8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- 
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=../modules modules_install</code></p>

<p>Leave this answer blank.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Now we need to transfer our recently compiled kernel and modules back to our 
Raspberry Pi in order to install them. 

Open up a local terminal on your Pi.
As you did on the server, create a directory called <code>linux_source</code> that will
serve as a place to organize your code. Move inside your <code>linux_source</code> directory 
and create a directory called <code>lib</code> and another directory called
<code>boot</code>. The naming is important, because the Pi's version of sftp will 
only transfer entire directories if the source and destination folders have the 
same name. From your <code>linux_source</code> directory run the following commands:<p></p>

<p><code>sftp [your wustl key]@shell.cec.wustl.edu</code></p>
<p><code>cd linux_source</code></p>
<p><code>get -r modules/lib/</code></p>
<p><code>get -r linux/arch/arm/boot/</code></p>
<p><code>get linux/scripts/mkknlimg</code></p>
<p><code>quit</code> (to get back to your Pi)</p>

<p>Back up your directories <code>/lib</code> and <code>/boot</code>, because you will 
be modifiying their contents. To do this, we used 
<code>sudo cp -r /lib ~/Desktop/lib_backup</code> and a similar
command for <code>/boot</code>. You should be in
your <code>linux_source</code> directory. If not navigate there and
run the following commands:</p>

<p><code>cd lib</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp -rd * /lib/</code></p>
<p><code>cd ..</code></p>
<p><code>KERNEL=kernel7</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays</code></p>
<p><code>sudo ./mkknlimg boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img</code></p>

<p>At this point, your new kernel is installed. When you reboot, you'll be
running your very own, custom kernel.</p>

<p> Go ahead and reboot now. If everything went OK,
the new system should look and feel the same as before. You can verify
that your new kernel is running with the command <code>uname -a</code>.
In particular, the build date should be today, the version string should
include the local version string you specifed during configuration, and
your Linux source code version with
the characters "rt" should appear, which indicates that the PREEMPT_RT patch 
has been applied.</p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy the output of <code>uname -a</code>.</p><p>

</p><p>Congratulations! You've just compiled an operating system from source!</p>

</p><p></p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3><p></p>
<ol>
<p></p><li>The instructions above are lengthier and convoluted because we're
building a kernel specifically for the <i>Raspberry Pi 3</i>. If you'd like
the experience of bulding a general purpose kernel, or if you're curious about
building on a different machine, you can do so easily. First, go to
kernel.org and download any recent release. Unzip the release (and if you'd like,
apply the PREEMPT_RT patch). Then, building a general kernel is just a
few commands:<p></p>

<p><code>make menuconfig</code></p>
<p><code>make -jN</code> where N is the number of cores you want to use to compile</p>
<p><code>sudo make modules_install install</code></p>

<p>That's all there is to it! The <code>install</code> targets will
automatically and correctly install the new kernel on the common
Linux distributions. In the base source code directory there's a file called
README which contains compilation and installation instructions for a wide
range of scenarios.</p>

<p>For a sufficently powerful machine, building a new kernel is pretty
painless. Our lab's 16 core, 3.2Ghz Intel machines take about 15 minutes
to compile and install.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Follow the instructions for <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/onboard_compilation.html">Compiling 
On-Board your Raspberry Pi</a>, and as the answer to this exercise summarize what
differences you noted (including any problems you encountered) compared to the
cross-compilation approach noted above.

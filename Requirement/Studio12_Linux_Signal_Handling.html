<p>Signals are a simple yet powerful way for Linux processes to communicate
in pre-defined ways. They are ideally suited for inter-process event handling 
during system operation. Signals can be sent to any process in the system, and
can be recieved by defining special functions called <i>signal handlers</i>,
which are executed upon receipt of the signal.
</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate and recieve program signals
  </li><li>Create custom signal handlers
  <!-- <li>See how signals are used to implement exceptions -->
</li></ol>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>For the first exercise we will find an existing program to handle
signals with a custom signal handler. Find a clean copy of the 
<code>dense_mm</code> program that we used earlier. Build this program and
run it.
While this program is executing, send it the keyboard interrupt signal
(<code>SIGINT</code>) by highlighting its terminal and pressing CTRL+C
(hold down the CTRL button and press C). As the answer to this exercise,
copy and paste the result from successfully interrupting your program.<p></p>



<p></p></li><li>There are many signals that can be sent or recieved in Linux. An overview
of the signalling mechanism can be found at the manual page
<code>man 7 signal</code>. Some commonly used signals are <code>SIGINT</code>
(keyboard interrupt), <code>SIGQUIT</code> (quit from keyboard), and
<code>SIGTERM</code> (terminate process). Every signal in the system is
associated with a default action (which typically terminates the recieving
process), but this can be overridden simply by defining
your own signal handling function, which is what we will now do.<p></p>

<p>The modern, portable way to define a signal handler is to use the function
<code>sigaction()</code> which is documented at <code>man sigaction</code>. Use
this function to define a new handler for <code>SIGINT</code>. You will need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a handler function with the signature: <code>void function_name (int arg)</code>
</li><li>Create a <code>struct sigaction</code> in your <code>main()</code> function
</li><li>Assign the <code>sa_handler</code> field of your <code>struct sigaction</code> to your signal handling function
</li><li>Assign the <code>sa_flags</code> field of your <code>struct sigaction</code> to <code>SA_RESTART</code>
</li><li>Call the <code>sigaction()</code> function with <code>SIGINT</code> as the signum argument and a pointer to your <code>struct sigaction</code> for the act argument.
</li></ul>

<p>Declare a global counter and increment it when the handler function is
called. At the end of your <code>main()</code> function print the value of
this counter. Copy and paste a sample program output as the answer to this
exercise.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Overriding the <code>SIGINT</code> handler may make it
difficult to terminate your program. You can alternately use CTRL+\ to send
the <code>SIGQUIT</code> signal or the <code>kill</code> program to terminate
your processes.</p>

<p></p></li><li>One way that signal handlers are special functions is that they execute
asynchronously with respect to the rest of a program. When called, they may
interrupt the normal execution of the program at virtually any point. Consider
what might happen, for example, if the same function is called from both the
regular program flow as well as a signal handler. This could result in the
function being called concurrently from two different contexts, even within
a single-threaded program! This could cause data corruption or even deadlock
if not handled appropriately.<p></p>

<p>Even library functions are not immune to problems with asynchronicity.
Download the program <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/studios/print5000.c"><code>print5000.c</code></a>, build
and run it. This is a very simple program that defines a signal handler for
<code>SIGINT</code>, and then prints the numbers from 1 to 5000 in order.
Try running this program and interrupting it with <code>SIGINT</code>. Inspect
the program output where it was possibly interrupted by a signal handler.</p>

<p>What happens? Copy and paste evidence.</p>

<p></p></li><li>For the reasons outlined above, it is not safe to make many common
system calls or library function calls from within a signal handler. Many such
functions, such as <code>printf()</code> are not guaranteed to execute
correctly when called from within a handler, since they may be called
concurrently from different contexts.
Fortunately, there is a list of functions that is guaranteed to be safe
when called from a handler. These functions are given in the signal documentation
at <code>man 7 signal</code> under "Async-signal-safe functions".<p></p>

<p>Going back to your original program, use the <code>write()</code> function
documented at <code>man 2 write</code> to produce output from within a signal
handler. In particular, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declare an array of characters (e.g. <code>char* message = "error message\n"</code>)
</li><li>Count the number of characters you want to print
</li><li>Use the <code>write()</code> function with argument fd equal to zero to write to standard output (e.g. <code>write(0, message, num_chars);</code>)
</li></ul>

</li></ol>

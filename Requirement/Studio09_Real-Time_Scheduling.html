</p><p>Linux's real-time scheduling classes are for processes that require a great
deal of control over how they execute. They can be used to define programs that
execute in very specific ways, and are even used preempt the operating system 
kernel.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a program that uses the real-time scheduler
  </li><li>Use the kernel tracer to examine how this program runs
</li></ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>
</p><p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
finished email your results to <strong>eng-cse522@email.wustl.edu</strong> with
the phrase <strong>
Real-Time Scheduler
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>First, we'll need a program to run as a real-time workload. In the last
studio you created an infinite-loop program, which we'll modify to use here.
One problem / feature is that a real-time workload is capable of preempting the
kernel itself- this can make it impossible for the kernel to stop misbehaving
programs, so in general it's a very bad idea to create such programs with
infinite loops. Rather than using an infinite loop, modify your program so
that, rather than looping forever, it increments a loop index to five hundred million
(500,000,000). This will provide a CPU bound task that's guaranteed to
finish.<p></p>

<p><i>NOTE: Modern compilers are smart enough to optimize your loop away.
Turn off optimizations for this exercise.</i> With no optimization, 
on the 900 MHz Raspberry Pi 3, the instructor's program 
runs for about five seconds. For -O1 it runs for about a half second. For
any higher optimization level the program returns immediately. Use the
<code>time</code> command to ensure that your program runs for around five
seconds.</p>



<p></p></li><li>Now, use the <code>trace-cmd</code> command to record sched_switch
events during an execution of your program. Recall that the synatx for
this is "<code>sudo trace-cmd record -e sched_switch ./your_program arg1 arg2 ...
</code>". Then use Kernelshark to inspect the trace.<p></p>

<p>Examine how your program executes. List three processes that interefere
with the execution of your program. Make a copy of your trace to inspect later-
next time we run <code>trace-cmd</code> it will overwrite this one.</p>


<p></p></li><li>Modify your workload program so that it sets and uses the SCHED_RR
scheduling class. This program should take two arguments- the first should specify the
core to execute upon, and the second should specify the real-time scheduling
priority.<p></p>

<p>To do so, you should use the function <code>sched_setscheduler()</code>
that is documented at <code>man sched_setscheduler</code>. The required
data structure, <code>sched_param</code>, is also documented at that page.
Be sure to check the return value from this function for success, and print
out an appropriate error message in the event of failure.</p>


<p></p></li><li>Run your program under <code>trace-cmd</code> with a real-time
priority of one. 
Inspect the output in Kernelshark. What do you notice? Do any processes
preempt your program? If so, which ones?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Compare this execution trace to your original non-real-time trace.
Is there any qualitative
difference in how these interruptions occur?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Filter the text box to only show events from the processor that your
program used. To do so, go to the <code>Filter</code> menu and select
<code>list CPUs</code>. How many <code>sched_switch</code> events were 
recorded on this CPU?<p></p>

<p>Filter your list to a different CPU. How many <code>sched_switch</code>
events were recorded there?</p>

<p></p></li><li>Use the command <code>ps -e -o cmd,rtprio</code> to get a list of
all processes on the system and their real-time priorities. A dash in the
priority column means that this process does not have a real-time priority.<p></p>

<p>Which real-time priorities do you see used? Give two processes with a real-time
priority and speculate why they deserve a real-time priority.</p>


<p></p></li><li>Run your program again with a real-time priority of 99. How many
<code>sched_switch</code> events occur on your program's processor? Is your
program ever preempted? If so, when and where is it preempted?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Our next goal is to execute
multiple simultaneous real-time processes together, but this is slightly trickier
than you might think. If you create one real-time process, it will be
impossible to create a second real-time process on that same processor until
the first one finishes. Why is this?
<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Make a copy of your real-time workload program. Modify it so that
it takes a third argument, which will be the number of real-time tasks to
create. Using this value, insert appropriate calls to
the <code>fork()</code> function. This function should be called
AFTER you have set the program's
real-time priority, but BEFORE you start executing your work loop.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Use your modified program to create three simultaneous real-time
workloads. Trace the execution, and inspect the trace in Kernelshark. What
do you see? Use the markers to measure the length of a round-robin time-slice.
Recall that you can set marker A with a left mouse click, and set marker B
with shfit + left mouse click.<p></p>

<h3>Things to turn in</h3>

</p><h2>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>Linux contains two other real-time scheduling classes, called
<code>SCHED_FIFO</code> and (much more recently) <code>SCHED_DEADLINE</code>.
Under the former policy, tasks are allowed to run to completion or until they
give up the processor with <code>sched_yield()</code>. Under the latter policy,
tasks are given deadlines for completion, and scheduled in order to best meet
those deadlines. Try them out!

"I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo.

"So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that 
is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time 
that is given, us."

</p><p>Benchmarking programs is a common task that drives decisions about where
and how to invest the effort of software developers. This task can be
very simple to very complex, depending on desired accuracy and the kind
of code being profiled. In an OS, code that is run very infrequently or
at a low priority doesn't need to be validated to as high a standard as code
that runs very frequently (such as the system timer interrupt handler) or
at high priority (such as real-time priority). Benchmarking in userspace
serves as an introduction to the concepts behind benchmarking in the kernel, 
and it allows us to measure the impact of the kernel on userspace performance.

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>First, we need some programs to benchmark. I've put together a code
package that includes four programs for us to use. Download it
<a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/studios/test_programs.tgz">here</a>. Unzip the package, build the programs
with the provided makefile, and run each one a few times. As the answer to this
exercise, list what each program does.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>We can do some very coarse grained benchmarking straight from
the command line, using a bash command named <code>time</code>. This is
actually a special command built into the bash shell, so its documentation
can be found under <code>man bash</code>. As the answer to this exercise,
use this command to make a few timings of the test programs and copy the
results here.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>The <code>time</code> command outputs three different timings. List them
here and explain the difference.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Compare the results of the following two commands. What do you observe
about the relationship between the <code>user</code> and <code>real</code>
timings? Explain your observations.<p></p>
<ul>
<li><code>time ./dense_mm 400</code>
</li><li><code>time ./parallel_dense_mm 400</code>
</li></ul>

<p></p></li><li>Execute the following command. What do you observe about the
relationship between the <code>user</code> and <code>sys</code> timings?
Look at the code in <code>sing.c</code> and explain your observations.<p></p>
<ul>
<li><code>time ./sing 1000</code>
</li></ul>


<p></p></li><li>Now we're going to switch to using the C API for Linux's clocks. First,
we'll look at exactly what clocks are available and get some info about each
with the function <code>clock_getres</code>. You can access the documentation
for this function in the manual pages: <code>man clock_getres</code>.
<span style="color:red"><b><i>Warning:</i></b></span> <i>Internet versions of
man pages are often not up to date. Use the version on your machine.</i><p></p>

<p>Look through the clocks available at the <code>clock_getres</code> man page.
For this exercise, give two clock names. For the first, give a clock that would
 be well suited for userspace benchmarking, and explain why. For the second,
give a clock that would be poorly suited for userspace benchmarking, and
explain why.</p> 

<p></p></li><li>Next, use <code>clock_getres</code> to write a short program called
<code>getres.c</code>that gives
the resolutions for several different clock types. This function requires
using a structure called a <code>timespec</code> which is also documented at 
the same man page, and is the basic data structure used to report timing 
information from the kernel to userspace.<p></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste your program output.
Include at least one <code>_COARSE</code> clock type.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Explain what is meant by the resolution values returned from your
program.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Given what you know about Linux timers, the HZ variable, and jiffies
from chapter 11 in our book, speculate about the difference between
<code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code> and <code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE</code>.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Write a second short program that uses the function
<code>clock_gettime</code> to figure out how long a call to
<code>clock_gettime</code> takes. As the answer to this exercise,
report this value.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li> Make a copy of <code>parallel_dense_mm.c</code>. First modify it so 
that you time the critical computational loop with the clock 
<code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW</code>. Then modify it again so that the program
takes a second parameter and executes the timed segment multiple times. Your
program should output the minimum, average, and maximum timings over all
timed iterations.<p></p>

<p>Leave the answer to this exercise blank</p>

<p></p></li><li>Run your program for 100 iterations with matrix size 100. What are the
reported values? Speculate about the total distribution of values- based on
the minimum, avgerage, and maximum timings, what do you think a common running
time actually is? Give an explanation for the distribution of values.<p></p>

</li></ol>

<p></p><h2>Things to turn in</h2><p></p>
<p>In addition to the answers above, please submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>getres.c
</li><li>Your copy of parallel_dense_mm.c
</li></ul>

<p>Pipes and FIFOs are efficient ways to do file-like input and output
between processes. Their biggest benefit is the ability to treat the
endpoints as formatted input and output streams, just like you would
read and write from files, or from streams like standard input and output.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create and pass data through pipes with the <code>pipe()</code> system call
  </li><li>Create and pass data through FIFOs with the <code>mkfifo()</code> function
  </li><li>Implement a rudimentary active object pattern with processes and FIFOs
</li></ol>

Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
finished email your results to <strong>eng-cse522@email.wustl.edu</strong> with
the phrase <strong>
Linux Pipes
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>First we will use the <code>pipe()</code> system call to create a
communicating child and parent. However, once created, pipes cannot be shared
between executing processes. Thus, the standard way to use this system call is
to call the <code>pipe()</code> function, which will create separate pipe 
endpoints for reading and writing, and then to <code>fork()</code> the process.
Thus, the child will inherit the pipe endpoints from the parent, and both
processes now have access.<p></p>

<p>Create a program which:
</p><ol>
<li>Calls <code>pipe()</code> to create a pipe with read and write file descriptors (see
<code>man 2 pipe</code> for details)
</li><li>Calls <code>fork()</code> to create a child process
</li><li>After the fork, the child process closes its copy of the read file descriptor
with <code>close()</code>, and the parent process closes its copy of the write
file descriptor similarly
</li><li>After the fork, the child process writes several test messages to the pipe
</li><li>After the fork, the parent process reads several messages from the pipe and prints them to stdout
</li></ol><p></p>

<p>Pipe I/O, like file I/O in C, is comparatively low level. There are two
approaches you can use to read and write to your pipe. You could use
the integer file descriptors returned by <code>pipe()</code> directly with the <code>read()</code>
and <code>write()</code> system calls, documented at <code>man 2 read</code> 
and <code>man 2 write</code>. However you might find it easier to instantiate
a <code>FILE*</code> stream, which allows you to work with your pipe like it
was any other file object (i.e. you write to the pipe with <code>fprintf()</code>
and read from the pipe with intelligent input operations such as <code>fgets()</code>
or <code>fscanf()</code>. You can open a file stream from a file descriptor
with the <code>fdopen()</code> function.
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Streams-and-File-Descriptors.html">Read more about the difference
between file descriptors and file streams here</a>. Of course, all of the above
functions have informative man pages.</p>

<p>Hint: Blocking functions that read the pipe will block indefinitely until
they are able to return successfully or the write-end of the pipe is closed by
the writer. The writer should write all of it's data and then call
<code>close()</code> on its file descriptor when it is done. This allows you to
write code such as <code>while( fgets() != NULL )</code> to do open-ended reads,
on the pipe, which will eventually fail and return once the write-end is closed.</p> 

<p></p></li><li>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste the terminal output from
your program.

<p></p></li><li>Now we are going to implement a rudimentary active object. An active
object is an executable context that performs services for other contexts upon
request. In this case our active object will be a process that listens to one
end of a FIFO, does some trivial computation when data is recieved, and prints
the result of that computation to standard output. Any number of other processes
can open the FIFO's read side and submit data, and the order that requests are
scheduled depends on a race for the FIFO (recall that writes and reads are
atomic for less than <code>PIPE_BUF</code> sized data).<p></p>

<p>To begin, create a new file for your active object. This program should:
</p><ol>
<li>Create a new FIFO with the function <code>mkfifo()</code>. This is documented
at <code>man 3 mkfifo</code>. Be careful not to confuse it with the program
called <code>mkfifo</code> that is documented at <code>man 1 mkfifo</code>.
</li><li>Open the FIFO with read permission as though it were a file using
<code>fopen()</code>.
</li><li>Enter a <code>while</code> loop that continually attempts to read from the
FIFO. The same code you used to read from a pipe previously can be adapted
here. Whenever something is read, print it to the standard output.
</li></ol>

<p>When you run your program it will create a FIFO which will appear in the
filesystem. In a separate terminal, write some data into the FIFO and validate
that it is read by your program correctly. For example, if your FIFO is named
<code>my_ao_fifo</code>, the command "<code>echo "my_message" &gt; my_ao_fifo</code>
will insert "my_message" into the FIFO. Test your program with larger input
as well, for example: "<code>cat my_file.c &gt; my_ao_fifo</code>".

</p><p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste the terminal output.</p>


<p></p></li><li>Now, we will make two modifications to make your active object to perform a minimal but useful
purpose. After opening a read stream to the FIFO, also open a write stream
(i.e. <code>fopen( fifo_name, "w" )</code>. Your active object will not ever
write to this stream, but the fact that it is held open will prevent your
program from automatically quitting.<p></p>

<p>Next, modify the active object to read from the FIFO with the function
<code>fscanf()</code>. This allows you to perform formatted input. Your program
should read integer inputs from the pipe, double the input, and then print out the
original and the new values. Your input stream should not have any non-integer characters
and you do not need to handle this case.</p>

<p>Test your program by passing integers into your FIFO, and copy and paste the results
here.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Lastly, we want to write a set of programs that concurrently
use the FIFO to request work from the active object. Write two programs that
open the write end of the fifo with <code>fopen(fifo_name, "w")</code> and
insert integer values with <code>fprintf()</code>. One of these programs should only insert even numbers,
and the other should only insert odd numbers. Run these programs
long enough to verify that they can both write concurrently to the FIFO without
problem. Examine the output of your active object to verify correctness.<p></p>

<p></p><h3>Things to turn in:</h3><p></p>

<ul>
<li>The answers to the above exercises
</li><li>Your pipes program
</li><li>Your active object reader program
</li><li>Your active object writer(s) program(s)
</li></ul>

<p></p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3><p></p>
<ol>
<p></p><li>The active object we have constructed in somewhat limited. While it
allows processes to request some work to be performed, the true purpose of
the active object is to allow for remote procedure call semantics. This
would require that processes be able to submit work to be performed, and
then the results of that work would be returned directly to those specific
processes (rather than being printed to standard out). Such an implementation
has several challenges, such as how to multiplex/demultiplex the communication
channel, and how to create and organize additional channels to enable
bi-directional communication. Try implementing true remote procedure call
semantics.<p></p>

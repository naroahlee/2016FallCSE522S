<p>There was a big book with plain red leather covers; its tall pages were now almost filled. At the beginning there were many leaves covered with Bilbo's thin wandering hand; but most of it was written in Frodo's firm flowing script. It was divided into chapters but Chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that were some blank leaves.</p>

<p>"Why, you have nearly finished it, Mr. Frodo!" Sam exclaimed. "Well, you have kept at it, I must say."</p>

<p>"I have quite finished, Sam," said Frodo. "The last pages are for you."</p>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Create a new directory (outside of the Linux source tree) to hold your
kernel modules. Use pages 338 and 339 of <i>Linux Kernel Development</i> to 
write a simple "Hello, World!" module. Then create a Makefile that contains the
line "<code>obj-m := hello.o</code>". Finally, build the module with
the command 
"<code>make -C /linux/source/directory/ SUBDIRS=$PWD modules</code>", 
but replace the path with the root location of your Linux source tree.<p></p>

<p>What do you expect to happen when you load the kernel module?</p>

<p></p></li><li>Before loading your first module, you might want to clear the contents
of the system log. The same command (<code>dmesg</code>) that allows you to
view the system log also allows you to manipulate it. You can clear the log
with the command "<code>sudo dmesg --clear</code>".<p></p>

<p>The basic utility for loading modules into the kernel is called
<code>insmod</code>. The make process from before will have generated a
<code>.ko</code> file, which is the loadable module. Load your module now
with a command such as: "<code>sudo insmod hello.ko</code>"</p>

<p><i><b>NOTE:</b> The <code>insmod</code> utility has been superceeded
by another program called <code>modprobe</code>, which in general should
be used. <code>modprobe</code> is safer to use because it
performs dependency resolution between modules. We use 
<code>insmod</code> and <code>rmmod</code> here simply to
demonstrate the low-level tools that actually perform
module loading and unloading.</i>

</p><p></p></li><li>If you recieve no error messages, then your module has been
successfully loaded. However, there are two ways to verify this. First,
use the <code>lsmod</code> command to see a listing of all currently loaded
kernel modules. Verify that your module appears in the list. Second, verify
that the printk statement in your init function has shown up in the
system log. For the answer to this exercise, copy
the output of <code>lsmod</code> and the last few lines of the system
log here.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>The basic utility for removing modules from the kernel is called
<code>rmmod</code>. When using this tool you can specify the module name
(as shown in <code>lsmod</code>) or you can specify a <code>.ko</code> file.<p></p>

<p>Remove your module now, and verify its removal as before. As the answer to
this exercise, copy the output of <code>lsmod</code> and the last few lines
of the system log.</p>

<p></p></li><li>The major reason for kernel modules (as opposed to running a userspace
program with root permissions) is that module code has direct access to all of
the kernel's resources. Userspace programs, in contrast, must use the OS'es
interface (system calls) to access such resources, and even then, most of the
kernel is opaque to user processes.<p></p>

<p>One kernel variable we've talked about previous is the <code>jiffies</code>
counter. Recall that this variable keeps track of how many timer interrupts
have (theoretically) occured since system boot. Modify your kernel module
to print the value of this variable, it's an unsigned long. This value
is not directly accessible by userspace programs, but it is visible in
kernelspace.</p>

<p>Copy and paste a system log message that prints the <code>jiffies</code>
variable.</p>


<p></p></li><li>Module init and exit functions are supposed to use the "0/-E" return
convention. This means that these functions should return a 0 on success, or
in the event of a failure they return the negative value of one of the error
codes found in <code>/include/uapi/asm-gerneic/errno-base.h</code>. Modify
your init function to return positive and negative values, respectively.
What happens when you load the module? Check the system logs, what do you
find there?<p></p>

<!--
<p><li>cat /proc/kallsyms, ksymtab</p>

<p><li>Create symbol</p>
<p><li>Find in kallsyms</p>
<p><li>Create thread?</p>
<p><li></p>
<p><li></p>

<p></p><h2>Things to turn in</h2><p></p>
<p>In addition to the answers above, please submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel module(s) you created
</li></ul>

</li></ol>

<p></p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3><p></p>
<ol>
<p></p><li>Kernel symbols that are available to be used in loadable modules
are called <i>exported symbols</i> and are identified by the
<code>EXPORT_SYMBOL</code> macro. You can see a list of all kernel symbols
by looking at the file /proc/kallsyms, e.g. <code>cat /proc/kallsyms</code>.
You might notice that this is very similar to the symbol table of a traditional
application. (Which you can print with the program <code>nm</code>, if you've
never done it before. Try it on any binary!) In fact, their syntax is identical, so you can use
<code>man nm</code> to find some more information about how to decode the
contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>.<p></p>

<p>Symbols that have been exported can be found in this list with the prefixes
<code>__kstrtab_</code>, and <code>__ksymtab_</code>. These prefixes denote
a special kernel symbol that stores the name of the exported symbol and a
struct that stores information about the symbol, respectively. See the
definition of <code>EXPORT_SYMBOL</code> to see how these are generated.</p>

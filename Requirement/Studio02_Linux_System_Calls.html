</p><p>System calls are the fundamental, most stable interface that is provided by
the operating system. They are how user programs request the vast majority
of kernel actions: creating, reading, and destroying files; allocating and
freeing dynamic memory; executing new programs, etc.</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make system calls with the libc wrapper
  </li><li>Make system calls with the native Linux interface
  </li><li>Write your own system call
</li></ol>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>First we're going to make a system call through the
libc wrapper. This is the standard way that user programs make calls
to the kernel. You can find a complete list of system calls in the manual
pages with the command <code>man syscalls</code>.<p></p>

<p>Navigate outside of the linux source code directory
and make a new directory for your userspace programs, and a new file called
<code>lib_call.c</code>. In Linux, all users have an associated user ID number.
Write a short program that reads your user ID, then attempts to set it to
zero (the root uid),
and then reads it again with the functions <code>getuid</code> 
and <code>setuid</code>. Use the man pages at
<code>man getuid</code> and <code>man setuid</code> to understand what header
files you need to include and how to call these functions.</p> 

<p>Since the call to <code>setuid</code> may fail, we need to do proper unix
style error checking. Store the return value from setuid into a variable,
and follow it up with something like:</p>

<p><code> if( return_val != 0 ) printf("Error to setuid failed! Reason: %s\n", strerror(errno));</code></p>

<p>Again, you can use the man pages to determine which header files to include
with the commands <code>man printf</code>, <code>man strerror</code>, and
<code>man errno</code>.</p>

<p>At the end of your program, write out the before and after values of the user ID.
As the answer to this question, copy and paste your program output.</p>



<p></p></li><li>Now we're going to modify this program to use the native Linux syscall
interface as documented in <code>man syscall</code> (this is a different page
than we accessed before, which was <code>man <b>syscalls</b></code>).
Copy your program to a new file called <code>native_call.c</code> and replace
the calls to <code>getuid</code> and <code>setuid</code> with calls to
<code>syscall</code>. To do so, you will have to determine their ARM
architecture specific system call numbers by looking at the linux source files
<code>arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h</code><p></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste your program output.</p>



<p></p></li><li>Now we will begin the process of writing two new system calls into
the Linux kernel. The
first system call will override the protections built into the code for
<code>setuid</code> and give any process the root user ID (this is a bad thing
in general, but it is illustrative). You will write the second system call,
which will print a message into the kernel log.<p></p>

<p><b><i>Note:</i></b>When making changes to the linux source 
code, add the comment //AOS before each section. This, along with generating 
file diffs is how we will keep track of the changes made to the kernel.</p> 

<p>There are five discrete tasks we need to accomplish to do so:

</p><ol>
	<li>Declare a C function prototype inside the kernel
	</li><li>Write a C function implementation
	</li><li>Define a new system call number
	</li><li>Update the ARM architecture system call table
	</li><li>Update the total number of syscalls value in the kernel
</li></ol><p></p>

<p>First, we declare two new function prototypes that take no arguments at the 
bottom of <code>include/linux/syscalls.h</code>. Before doing so, make a backup
with the command <code>cp syscalls.h syscalls.h.orig</code></p> 

<p>You can use the prototype for
<code>sys_getuid</code> as a template for this. Make sure that you use
<code>void</code> in the argument list to indicate no arguments, since in
C programming a function declared <code>f(void)</code> is not the same as
a function declared <code>f()</code> (which inidicates that the function may
take any number of parameters of unknown type). Our new system call is going
to do something relatively bad (in operating system terms), so call it
<code>sys_badcall</code>. Make a second prototype that accepts one integer
parameter and call it what you would like.</p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, give the two function prototypes you've
made.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Second,
create a new file for the implementation under <code>arch/arm/kernel/</code>.
The naming convention for a file that only implements a system call is to
call the file by the syscall name, so since our prototype is called
<code>sys_badcall</code>, you would create the file <code>sys_badcall.c</code>.
(Additionally, there are other places we could have put this file, but since
we're only adding this call for the ARM architecture, this is the most
appropriate place.) Make a second file for your second system call in the
same place and with the same naming convention.<p></p>

<p>For the implementation of <code>sys_badcall</code>, copy and paste the
contents of the file found <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/studios/sys_badcall.c">here</a>. Take a moment
to look through this file. Notice that the function declaration isn't a normal
declaration, but actually made through the macro <code>SYSCALL_DEFINE0</code> 
(the zero comes from that this syscall takes zero arguments, and is defined
in <code>include/linux/syscalls.h</code>).</p>

<p>For the implementation of your second syscall, use sys_badcall.c as a
template. You'll need to change the <code>SYSCALL_DEFINE0</code> macro to
reference the name you came up with, as well as the fact that this function
accepts an integer parameter. You do this by passing the type and the name of
the parameter to the macro as such:</p>

<p><code>SYSCALL_DEFINE1( your_name, int, param_name )</code></p> 

<p>In the body of this syscall, use the kernel function <code>printk</code>
to print a message along with the value of the parameter. You can use
<code>printk</code> as you would use <code>printf</code>. Be sure to return
a proper return value from this function.</p>

<p>Leave the answer to this exercise blank. </p>

<p></p></li><li>We want to make sure that our two new files are included in the Linux
build process. The kernel has a robust build system, so this is easy. Open up
the makefile in the same directory as your source code files (which should be
<code>arch/arm/kernel/</code>) and add our two new files to the end of the
object file list, which starts on the line with <code>obj-y</code> (make sure
you do not add your files after a <code>\</code> character, as this specifies
the start of a new line.<p></p>

<p>Leave the answer to this exercise blank.</p>

<p></p></li><li>The implementation of our system calls is done, now we need to add them
into the kernel's system call interface. We will define two new system call
numbers in <code>arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h</code>.<p></p> 

<p>Before modifying this file, make a copy into <code>unistd.h.orig</code>.
Then, open the file and write system call numbers 391 and 392 for
sys_badcall and your own system call near the bottom of the file. Use the 
other system calls as a template for how to do so.</p>

<p>Next we will modify <code>arch/arm/kernel/calls.S</code>. This is actually
an ARM assembly language file that defines the system call table. Similar to
before, first make a backup of <code>calls.S</code> and then
add two new invocations of the <code>CALL</code> macro near the end
of the file for <code>sys_badcall</code> and your function.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to update the symbol that tells the kernel how many system
calls that it has. Go to <code>arch/arm/include/asm/unistd.h</code>, make a
backup copy, and update the value of <code>__NR_syscalls</code> to 396. This
seems strange, but on the ARM architecture the system call table can only be
certain sizes. See the enrichment exercises for more info.</p>

<p>Leave this exercise blank.</p>

<p></p></li><li>At this point the kernel is fully modified and can be recompiled. It's not
wise to try and rebuild only part of the kernel, so in the base linux source
directory (the one with <code>arch</code>, <code>init</code>,
<code>drivers</code>, etc.) you should issue the command <code>make
clean</code> to remove previous build products.<p></p>

<p>Then, to differentiate your
next kernel from your current, we'll modify the kernel LOCALVERSION. Rather
than using the <code>menuconfig</code> like last time, it's faster and easier
to modify the configuration directly. In the base directory, open the file
called <code>.config</code> (the leading period means that this is a hidden
file that is not normally displayed) and modify the
<code>CONFIG_LOCALVERSION</code> string to reflect the fact that this new
kernel implements studio 2.</p>

<p>You can now build your new kernel following the procedure outlined in
studio 1.</p> 



<p></p></li><li>Once your new kernel is booted and running (remember you can confirm
this with <code>uname -a</code>), you're now ready invoke your new system
calls. First, make a copy of <code>lib_call.c</code> and call it 
<code>badcall_call.c</code>. Then, replace the call to <code>
setuid</code> with a native system call to <code>sys_badcall</code>.<p></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste the output from
<code>badcall_call.c</code>.



</p><p></p></li><li>Next, we can test the system call you have written. Write a program
that invokes it with the native system call interface, remembering to
pass an additional argument. However, this system call writes to the system
message log. After executing your program, you can check the system log
with the command <code>dmesg</code>.<p></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste the last few lines of the
system message log.</p>

</li></ol>

<h2>Turning in this studio</h2>

<p>To submit this studio, include the answers to exercises given above,
attach the userspace programs you wrote, as well as diffs of the kernel
source code files you modified. To create a diff, use the diff program
with the backup versions of the source code you modified.</p>

<p>For example: <code>diff -up unistd.h unistd.h.orig &gt; unistd.h.diff</code></p>

<p>For this studio, you will submit:</p>

<ul>
<li>lib_call.c
</li><li>native_call.c
</li><li>badcall_call.c
</li><li>The file you used to test your new system call
</li><li>The file you created to hold your new system call under <code>arch/arm/kernel/</code>
</li><li>syscalls.h.diff from <code>include/linux/</code>
</li><li>unistd.h.diff from <code>arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/</code>
</li><li>unistd.h.diff from <code>arch/arm/include/asm/</code>
</li><li>calls.S.diff from <code>arch/arm/kernel/</code>
</li></ul>

<p>If you don't have an original copy for any of these files, you can find them
in the original source code package.</p>

<p></p><h3>Optional Enrichment Exercises</h3><p></p>
<ol>
<p></p><li>Look at arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S lines 99-109 and the end of arch/arm/kernel/calls.S and parse out exactly how large the system call table is. A few questions you should be able to answer if you really understand the process: What does the CALL macro do (defined in entry-common.S)? What are the different roles of the symbols NR_syscall and __NR_syscall? Calculate the value of the symbol syscalls_padding at the end of arch/arm/kernel/calls.S for a few different values of NR_syscalls.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>If you want to know more about the machine-level actions that occur
during a syscall, you can start with the detailed explanation given in the
manual to the native system call interface, <code>man syscall</code>.<p></p>

<p>The kernel code that contains the entry point for system calls is found
in <code>arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S</code>.</p>

<p>Even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke. The waters of the Deeping-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping hole was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in.</p>

</p><p>Locking primitives are important userspace tools for concurrent and parallel
programming. Two main types of locks exist. <i>Spinlocks</i> consume processor
time as a process waits, but are ideally suited for low-latency and
low-overhead appliations when critical section lengths are very short. 
Other locks allow processes to sleep while waiting, which can better utilize
processor time but results the higher overhead of sleeping and waking up
processes. </p>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>

<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Download <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/courses/cse522/studios/workload.c">this program</a>. This is a short
parallel workload that creates about five seconds of work on each processor
in a system. Build the program (see commented code) 
and verify that it occupies all of your system's
cores by using the <code>top</code> program and pressing 1.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Right now, all functions can execute the <code>critical_section()</code>
function simultaneously. This is undesirable, since critical sections typically
protect important shared data. First we will build a spin lock to protect access
to the <code>critical_section()</code> function.<p></p>

<p>Create an empty <code>lock</code> and
<code>unlock</code> function. These functions should take a pointer to a
volatile integer. Insert these functions into the code around the critical
section.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> Recall that the <code>volatile</code> specifier tells the compiler
that the value of a variable may change. In this case, the compiler interprets
a <code>volatile int*</code> to mean that the value pointed at by the pointer
may change unexpectedly, not that the pointer itself may change.</p>

<p></p></li><li>In order to treat an integer like a lock, we need to define two values
that represent the locked and unlocked states, respectively. Define these at
the top of your program with a compiler pound-define. Create two integer
variables that hold these values.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>In order to implement the <code>lock</code> and <code>unlock</code>
functions we'll use GCC's built-in atomic instructions. If we were working in
C++ we could use C++ 11's atomic instructions. If we didn't have access to GCC,
or if speed was very critical, we could implement these with assembly
instructions.<p></p>

<p>
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html">
The atomic built-in functions are documented here</a>.
For the spin lock we will use the function <code>__atomic_compare_exchange()
</code>. The first three arguments determine the semantic meaning of this
function: <i>ptr</i>, <i>expected</i>, and <i>desired</i>. When called,
this function atomically compares the contents of <i>ptr</i> and <i>expected</i>, and
if they are equal, writes the value of <i>desired</i> into <i>ptr</i>. The last
three arguments specify special memory orderings, but we'll just opt for a
strong ordering for this studio. The last three parameters to
invoke this function are as so:</p>

<p><code>__atomic_compare_exchange( ptr, expected, desired, false, __ATOMIC_ACQ_REL, __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)</code></p>



<p>To implement the lock function, you should check for the unlocked state
and write the value of the locked state. However, it's possible that this
function will fail (for example, if another process already holds the lock).
Thus, your lock function should attempt to swap the state of the lock variable,
and continue retrying indefinitely until it succeeds. <b>WARNING:</b> The swap
function will overwrite the value of <code>expected</code> when it fails!</p>

<p>Implement the unlock function with the same command. However, we only expect
the unlock function to be called when we already hold the lock. If the
call to <code>__atomic_compare_exchange()</code> fails, then rather than
retrying the function, you should print out an error message and return.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Lastly, create volatile integer to serve as your lock and initialize
it using your pound-define state value. 
Run your program and use each thread's finishing statement to verify
that only one thread enters the critical section at a time.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Now we will implement a sleep lock. The lock above consumes processor
time while it's waiting, because it continually retries the lock operation
until it succeeds. To implement our sleep lock, we will replace this behavior
with one where we try to acquire the lock, but if we fail, the thread sleeps
until it is later woken up. To begin, make a copy of your program and delete
the function bodies of <code>lock()</code> and <code>unlock()</code>, as well
as your lock state pound-defines.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>The sleep and wakeup mechanism we will use is a system call called <i>futex</i>,
which stands for a <i>fast userspace mutex</i>. The system call handles the
mechanism of sleeping and waking processes, but a userspace-side component must
decide how and when to use this capability. In particular, the futex is
designed to implement a semaphore on top of an integer. There are three states:<p></p>

<table border="3">
	<tbody><tr><td>Unlocked:</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Locked:</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>At least one process is sleeping:</td><td>any negative number</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Since the futex is designed to implement a semaphore, this means that
processes lock and unlock the futex by atomic increments and decrements. When a
process claims the futex, it atomically decrements the integer by one. When
a process releases the futex, it atomically increments the integer by one. If
two processes never conflict, then the value of the futex integer will always
be zero or one, and no process will ever have to sleep (and thus, you will
never need to make a futex system call).</p>

<p>However, if multiple processes try to lock the futex simultaneously, they will
decrement the integer value to be negative. In this case, a process that gets
some value less than zero will want to put itself to sleep, and the kernel
must become involved. The semantics and the particulars of this process
are documented at the man pages <code>man 2 futex</code> and 
<code>man 7 futex</code>.</p>

<p></p></li><li>First, declare the locked and unlocked states in a pound-define
at the top of your program.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Implement your lock function with the following algorithm.<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Decrement the lock integer with <code>ret_val = __atomic_sub_fetch( lock_ptr, 1, __ATOMIC_ACQ_REL );</code>
</li><li>Check to see if the return value is less than zero
</li><li>If yes, we need to sleep. Set the lock integer to -1 with <code>__atomic_store_n( lock_ptr, -1, __ATOMIC_RELEASE );</code>
</li><li>Then call the system call: <code>syscall( SYS_futex, lock_ptr, FUTEX_WAIT, -1, NULL );</code>
</li><li>Then go back to step 1
</li><li>If no, exit the <code>lock()</code> function
</li></ol>

<p></p></li><li>Implement your unlock function with the following algorithm.<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Increment the lock integer with <code>ret_val = __atomic_add_fetch( lock_ptr, 1, __ATOMIC_ACQ_REL );</code>
</li><li>Check to see if the return value is one
</li><li>If yes, exit the <code>unlock()</code> function
</li><li>If no, we need to wake up some sleeping thread. Set the lock integer to 1 with __atomic_store_n( lock_ptr, 1, __ATOMIC_RELEASE );
</li><li>Then call the system call: <code>syscall( SYS_futex, lock_ptr, FUTEX_WAKE, INT_MAX );</code>
</li></ol>

<p></p></li><li>Create a volatile integer to serve as your lock. Initialize it with your pound-define unlocked value. 
Run your program and verify that only one thread is able to access the critical section at a time.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Trace both versions of your program with <code>trace-cmd record -e 
sched_switch</code>. Take a screen shot showing both behaviors.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Notice that your spin lock is able to do synchronization entirely in
userspace, while the futex lock requires the intervention of the kernel.
Would it be possible to do a sleep lock entirely in userspace (i.e. with no
system calls)?<p></p>

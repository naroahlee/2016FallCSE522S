<h2 style="text-align: center;">Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)</h2>

<p><i>
Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody's birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week.

</p><p>Linux's CFS strives to be <i>completely fair</i>, meaning that all processes
should recieve an equal share of the processor time. 
In particular, if there are
a total of <i>N</i> processes in the system, then all processes will ideally recieve
exactly <i>1/N</i>th of the processor time. In this studio we will explore the
CFS from user space. 
</p>

<p>In this studio, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create workloads to influence the scheduler
  </li><li>Analyze the scheduler from userspace
</li></ol>

</p><p>
Please complete the required exercises below, as well as any optional
enrichment exercises that you wish to complete.</p> 

<p>
As you work through these exercises, please record your answers, and when
finished email your results to <strong>eng-cse522@email.wustl.edu</strong> with
the phrase <strong>
CFS Studio
</strong> in the subject line.</p>

<p><strong> Make sure that the name of each person who worked on these exercises
is listed in the first answer, and make sure you number each of your responses
so it is easy to match your responses with each exercise.</strong></p>

</p><p></p><h3>Required Exercises</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As the answer to the first exercise, list the names of the people who
worked together on this studio.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Before we begin we need to disable a certain scheduling heuristic that
influences the exercises in this studio. Change the value of the file
<code>/proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled</code> from 1 to 0. You can
do this with the command <code>echo 0 &gt; sched_autogroup_enabled</code>, but
you will probably have to have a root terminal (<code>sudo bash</code>) in
order to modify the value. If we did not do this, then the way that you
invoked the exercises in this studio would influence your results.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Now we will create a CPU-bound workload. The simplest CPU-bound
program is a <code>while(1)</code> loop, but we want a little control over
where this task executes. To do this, we will use Linux's <i>processor
affinities</i>.<p></p>

<p>For this exercise, write a infinite-loop program that takes one integer argument
which gives the processor that the program should execute upon. In order to
control where your process is allowed to run you can use the function
<code>sched_setaffinity()</code>. To use this function you will need to specify
the set of allowable CPUs with a variable of type <code>cpu_set_t</code>. In
order to manipulate this data type you should use the functions documented in
<code>man CPU_SET</code>. This is a nonstandard extension, so you will need to
place <code>#define _GNU_SOURCE</code> before you include <code>sched.h</code>.
</p>

<p>Verify that your program runs continuously on a processor of your choosing
with the <code>top</code> or <code>trace-cmd</code> commands.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Your Raspberry Pi has four processors, and the Linux convention is to
number them starting with zero. Create an infinite loop task on each of 
processors 0, 1, 2, and 3 to fully occupy your system. We will call these
tasks the <i>background workload</i>.<p></p>

<p>Take a moment and marvel at the fact that your system hasn't come crashing
to a halt. Do a few tasks of your own choosing (text editing, internet
browsing, etc.) and make a subjective judgement of how well the system responds
now versus before you started the infinite loop tasks.</p>

<p>As the answer to this question, describe your experience.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Now we'll use the <code>dense_mm</code> program from previous studios
to examine the behavior of CPU-bound tasks on a heavily loaded system. First,
kill your background workload and 
use the command <code>time ./dense_mm 300</code> to get a rough measure of
program execution time on a quiet system. Now, restart the background tasks
and run the same command again.<p></p>

<p>As the answer to this exercise, copy and paste each response.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Compare the <code>real</code> and <code>user</code> timings.
What does the previous exercise tell you about the way that two
CPU-bound tasks share a processors under the CFS?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>What do you think will happen to the <code>real</code> and <code>
user</code> time of <code>dense_mm 300</code> if you were to increase the
number of background tasks?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Create new background tasks so that each processor contains two infinte
loop tasks. Execute the command <code>time ./dense_mm 300</code> and copy and
paste the results here. What happened?<p></p>

<p>Two helpful tips. You can detach a command from the terminal by executing it
with an ampersand (&amp;) at the end. Also, you can kill all tasks matching a
a certain string with the <code>pkill</code> command. For example, if I named
my infinite loop task <code>while</code>, then I could create multiple tasks
on processor zero with the command <code>./while 0 &amp;</code>. When I was
done, I could kill all outstanding tasks with the command
<code>pkill while</code>.</p>


<p></p></li><li>Reset your system so that only one background task exists on each
processor.
The CFS scheduler doesn't have a direct notion of timeslice or priority,
but Linux's <code>nice</code> priorities do influence the proportion of
time a task recieves.
Run the command <code>time sudo nice -n -20 ./dense_mm 300</code>. What
proportion of time (<code>user</code> divided by <code>real</code>)
did the task recieve?<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Repeat the previous exercise for nice priorities -10, -5, 0,
5, 10, and 19. You probably don't
want to wait for 19 to finish, so stop the task after a while with
<code>CTRL-C</code>. Compute their runtime proportions.<p></p>

<p></p></li><li>Plot the values from the last exercise on a graph. What does the
function look like?<p></p>

<body><h2 style="text-align: center;">CSE 522S: Compiling On-Board your Raspberry Pi</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>Cross compilation is advantageous in many cases, especially on a multi-core
server with significantly more processing power than your Raspberry Pi.  However,
in some cases such resources may not be available and in any case it's worth
understanding how to build kernels and other software directly on-board a Raspberry Pi
computer itself.</p><p>

To get started, first ssh into your Raspberry Pi computer using its IP address (which you
can obtain by issuing the <code>ifconfig</code> or <code>hostname -I</code> command in
a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi.</p><p>  If you encounter problems with your Raspberry
Pi freezing up during any of the steps below, you may want to reboot it, obtain its IP 
address, and then unplug the HDMI, mouse, and keyboard cables from your Raspberry Pi (to
avoid problems involving their device drivers) before accessing the running Raspberry Pi 
(solely) through SSH.</p><p>

<strong>Please note that the instructions that follow also can be performed directly within
a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi itself, though we assume SSH is used to avoid problems
with the Raspberry Pi itself freezing up during compiles and other long-running 
operations.</strong></p><p>


</p><p></p><h3>Instructions for On-Board Kernel Compilation</h3><p></p>

<ol>
<p></p><li>As you did in the first studio, make a new directory called 
<code>linux_source</code> to organize your source 
code, move into that directory,
and then issue the following commands, each of which will take several minutes:<p></p>

<p><code>wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/archive/raspberrypi-kernel_1.20160506-1.tar.gz</code></p>
<p><code>tar -xzf raspberrypi-kernel_1.20160506-1.tar.gz</code></p>

<p>Once the files finish unzipping you'll have a new directory, which you should again 
rename to be something simpler like <code>linux</code>.</p>

<p></p></li><li>Next, you will apply a Linux source code patch (the RT_PREEMPT
patch, which has the identifier "rt").  Go to
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/">kernel.org/pub/linux</a>, 
which is the public Linux source code repository, and click through "kernel",
"projects", and then "rt". You again will need to use the correct source code
patch that matches the version of the Linux kernel that you're using. 
For example, if you have source code version "4.0.7", then you will move to 
the directory "4.0" and download "patch-4.0.7-rt11.patch.gz". (<strong>Warning: 
do NOT use the file that starts with "patches"</strong>, the patch file contains 
the complete, current version of the patch, while the patches file contains data 
necessary to update from the last issued version of the rt patch.)<p></p>

<p>Download the appropriate patch file ending in gz, and move it into the 
<code>linux_source</code> directory, or from that directory simply fetch it
directly using the <code>wget</code> command. To apply the patch, move into 
your <code>linux</code> source code directory (the one with arch, drivers, init, etc.) 
and issue the following command: (you will need to change
version numbers)</p>

<p><code>zcat ../patch-4.0.7-rt11.patch.gz | patch -p1</code></p>

<p></p></li><li>Now we'll verify that our system has all of the
required prerequisites for building the kernel, by issuing the command:<p></p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install bc ncurses-dev</code></p>

<p></p></li><li>To configure the Linux kernel (starting from reasonable default settings
for the Raspberry Pi), issue the commands:<p></p>

<p><code>KERNEL=kernel7</code> (this is used by some build scripts)</p>
<p><code>make bcm2709_defconfig</code></p>

Next, we want to set a custom configuration option. Issue the command:<p></p>

<p><code>make menuconfig</code></p>

<p>After a moment, you'll get a kernel configuration menu. First, we
will enable the RT_PREEMPT patch we applied previously. Go into
"Kernel Features", and then select "Preemption Model". If the patch
was applied correctly, you'll have the option "Fully Preemptible
Kernel (RT)", which you should select.</p>

<p>Next you'll add your own unique identifier to the kernel you build.
Navigate to "Local version" under "General setup". The local version
string you specify here will be appended to the output of the 
<code>uname</code> command. If you applied the default <i>Raspberry Pi</i>
configuration correctly, this should be set to "<code>-v7</code>". Go ahead
and add your own unique identifier, though recall that <code>uname</code>
already gives you the kernel version number, the day and time the kernel was
compiled, as well as other info.<b>Warning: do not include a space in the
local version string- this will break the build script when you run 
<code>sudo make modules_install</code></b>.</p>

<p>Once you're done, exit the configurator
and be sure to answer "Yes" when asked to save your changes.</p> 


<p></p></li><li>Finally, we're able to start compiling the kernel, which will take 
about an hour and a half.  To begin, issue the command:<p></p>

<p><code>make -j4 zImage modules dtbs</code></p>

<p>Once it's done, issue the following commands:</p>

<p><code>KERNEL=kernel7</code> (if you've logged out since issuing this command before)</p>
<p><code>sudo make modules_install</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/</code></p>
<p><code>sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/</code></p>
<p><code>sudo scripts/mkknlimg arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img</code></p>

<p>At this point, your new kernel is installed. When you reboot, you'll be
running your very own, custom kernel.</p>

<p> Go ahead and reboot now. If everything went OK,
the new system should look and feel the same as before. You can verify
that your new kernel is running with the command <code>uname -a</code>.
In particular, the build date should be today, the version string should
include the local version string you specifed during configuration, and
your linux source code version with
the characters "rt" should appear, which indicates that the PREEMPT_RT patch 
has been applied.</p>
